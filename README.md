## Project Title
The University of British Columbia Website landing page clone

# UBC
    This is a landing page design for The University of British Columbia. 
    The idea is to recreate the original design and test my ability to clone it.
    It's a simple landing page design and sub-pages have not been coded because the aim is simply on the landing page 
    and not on the entire website.

## Pull Guide
Follow the following steps to collaborate:
1. Visit the Repository of the Project on Github Website: "https://github.com/DeyokaOfficial/UBC" <br/>
2. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.* <br/>
3. Make a local clone: 
     Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page 
     Copy the URL for the forked Repo "https://github.com/DeyokaOfficial/UBC" 
     Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace <br/>
     Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location <br/>
     In your Terminal, type: <br/>
        `git clone https://github.com/DeyokaOfficial/UBC`
4. Open terminal and set upstream branch: <br/>
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/DeyokaOfficial/UBC`
5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github
10. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
